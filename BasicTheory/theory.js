// Routing generally works in RESTful APIs:

/**
HTTP Methods:
- HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., are used to perform different actions on resources. For example:

GET /users: Retrieve a list of users.
GET /users/123: Retrieve the user with ID 123.
POST /users: Create a new user.
PUT /users/123: Update the user with ID 123.
DELETE /users/123: Delete the user with ID 123.
